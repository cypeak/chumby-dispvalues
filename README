this is a small qt application for the chumby device.

it reads the sensor data from the flukso device specified and displays 
the nearly realt-time consumtion values. including moving averages
(1min, 10min, 1h). 
there is also a graphical representation (plot) of the sensor values 
displaying the conumption curve for the last 15 minutes. notice that 
the flukso only delivers the sensor values for the last 60 seconds, so
it takes about 15 minutes to  gather values for a 15minutes timeframe..


WARNING: there no guarantee whatsorever for this application since it's 
a work-in-progress project.
